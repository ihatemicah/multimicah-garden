### ‚úèÔ∏è description
I often get asked what's the best way to learn Blender, and my next question to them would be **what style are you trying to grow into?**
<br>
So, I'm going to continously update this page based on the best resources to learn a specific style as I continue to grow my knowledge as well.

### ‚òÆÔ∏è trippy / psychedelic 
Whenever I'm looking for new resources within this category, the keywords are "concert visuals & vj'ing" and with those you'll def run into what you're looking for.

###  üëΩ abstract / c4d like
now, we've all seen the cool clean 3D objects that have a level of abstraction to it all -- used in commercials or honestly now in just marketing design on the web. compiling some youtubers i've seen create content with this style. 
<br>
<br>
üé• channels:
<br>

[Ducky3D](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuNhGhbemBkdflZ1FGJ0lUQ) - Ducky played a HUGE role in my learning with Blender, and a lot of the social posts I've made using 3D assets. 
<br>

[Default Cube](https://www.youtube.com/c/DefaultCube) - Some of Default Cube's tutorials aren't for a new Blender user but, trust me you'll find some cheat codes from Blender you've never come across before. 
<br>

[Redjam9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpdGdXzKqCdOjrMR084sMRA/featured) - Red has been pumping out some great content around geometry nodes creating massive abstract animations. 
<br>

[CBaileyFilm](https://www.youtube.com/c/CBaileyFilm/videos) - Chris' channel contains quite a range of stuff from character animations to vj like effects, but at the core I believe there's def the clean professional C4D vibe.  
<br>

[G.E.T Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/GETTUTORIALS123/videos) - Amazing repo of just pure abstract animations and figures. 
<br>

[Intranet Girl](https://www.youtube.com/c/intranetgirlx) - y2kish but lots of great content. Her workflow video on recreating a liminal space is golden
